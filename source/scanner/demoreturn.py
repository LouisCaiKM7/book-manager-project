 'description': '"...focuses on the past and present of comparative politics and establishes the scientific justification for doing comparative politics, including why political scientists compare countries, how they compare countries, and strategies for choosing countries and problems of comparison. It also shows how comparative methods can help students understand and explain observed political phenomena in the world. It goes ahead to explain what analytical leverage can be added to a research problem by comparing one country to another, a few countries together, or many countries at once within the context of comparative methods that help to generate, clarify and support important theories and propositions of political science. This is done in a way of bridging the gap between European and African scholars. The book also offers an original interpretation of the knowledge in comparative politics in Africa accumulated over the years and thus, balances regional knowledge with comparative theory in order to address questions about African developmental trajectory."--Publisher description.',
